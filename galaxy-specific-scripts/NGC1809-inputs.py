#-----------------------------------------------
# Steps of data reduction you want to perform:
#---------------------------------------------
do_step = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
#  1: import_and_split_ant - Import data to MS and split by antenna    (adsm   -> asap)
#  2: gen_tsys_and_flag    - Generate tsys cables and apply flags      (create .tsys and swpmap)
#  3: counts2kelvin        - Calibration of Tsys and convert data to K (asap   -> asap.2)
#  4: extract_cube         - Extract cube with line                    (asap.2 -> asap.3)
#  5: baseline             - Baseline correction                       (asap.3 -> asap.4)
#  6: concat_ants          - Concatenate all antennas                  (asap.4 -> ms.5 -> cal.jy)
#  7: imaging              - Imaging and fix the header                (cal.jy -> image)
#  8: export_fits          - Export image and weight to a fits file    (image  -> fits)
